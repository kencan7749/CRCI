"""Cracking the Coding Interview 1.1: determine whether a string has all unique characters.

When you implement your solution, make sure to provide these callables:

1. ``has_unique_chars(text: str) -> bool``
   - Return ``True`` when ``text`` contains no repeated characters.
   - Return ``False`` otherwise.
   - Additional data structures are allowed.

2. ``has_unique_chars_no_extra(text: str) -> bool``
   - Same contract as above, but avoid extra data structures whose size grows with the input.
   - Constant-size helpers are fine.

Feel free to delete this message and structure the module however you prefer.
