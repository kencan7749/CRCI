"""Cracking the Coding Interview 1.2: check whether two strings are permutations of each other.

When solving the exercise, expose a function with this signature:

``are_permutations(first: str, second: str) -> bool``
    Return ``True`` when the two strings are permutations of each other (case- and
    whitespace-sensitive). Return ``False`` otherwise. You may add any helpers you like.

Feel free to delete these notes and implement the solution from scratch.
